## Color and sound

This interactive world will involve a sphere that moves with the mouse along the page. As the mouse moves to different areas of the screen, the colors change as well as the music that is being played. For example, the "red" area could have more intense music, whereas the "blue" area would have calming, relaxing music. This would use the p5.js sound library.

## Loading Screen Animation

This sketch will use the p5.js play library to make a fun animation for a loading screen. I can use the assets in the play library to create a loading page with moving parts in it.
