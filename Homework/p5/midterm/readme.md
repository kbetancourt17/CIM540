## Just Keep Swimming

I am making this project to produce a fun interactive game for kids to play online. My motivation is to utilize the different kinds of interaction we learned to create a fun game. My inputs are the fish moving from left to right, according to the position of mouseX. My outputs are the little fish appearing randomly and then disappearing when within a certain distance from the big fish. The target audience for my project is kids from age 7-10. My project will be displayed on a website and will be playable online.
